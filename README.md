DevMountain Final Group Project


Git Collaboration

- Make commits in terminal often
  - git add <file to commit>
  - git commit -m “put your comments here"
- When ready to add your code to the “upstream”
  - git pull upstream master -> brings you up-to-date and will show you if their are any conflicts that you need to resolve. Resolve those conflicts before moving on.
  - add and commit what you resolved
  - git push origin master -> pushes to your GitHub Repo
  * before creating Pull Request ask Bryson if he's ready for the request
  - go to your repo on GitHub and create a Pull Request
- When fetching “upstream” master
  - git pull upstream master -> brings your local repo up-to-date
  - git push origin master -> brings your GitHub repo up-to-date
